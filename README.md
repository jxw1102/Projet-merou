# Projet Mérou

Projet Mérou (Project Grouper in french ; name is totally irrelevant anyway !) is an end-of-studies 2-month project realized by a team of 5 computer science students. 

In this team project, we implemented a research paper proposing a model checking algorithm for static code analysis using temporal logic. We built a Scala tool that can parse the Clang syntax tree of an arbitrary C++ source code and convert it into an adapted control-flow graph which can then be used to find and extract extract patterns expressed in terms of temporal logic.
